In the context of a 2D quantum (valley) Hall photonic crystal, we need to calculate both the Berry curvature and the Chern number. To accomplish this, you'll require a Comsol-Matlab livelink.

To execute the code, follow these steps:
1. Utilize the Comsol-Matlab livelink to open the main file.
2. Enter the 'mphopen' command to access and read the .mph file.
3. Run the code.

For additional information, please consult the .docx file located in the 'square lattice' folder.

This project primarily relies on Comsol and Matlab. You can also access the .mlx files through Matlab.

Lastly, I recommend checking out the paper titled 'arXiv:2001.08913.' It provides a Matlab code for calculating the Chern number in photonic crystals, and you can find it in the reference list.
