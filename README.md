# Berry-curvature-for-photonic-crystals
Berry curvature and Chern number are computed for 2D quantum Hall photonic crystal.
See the .docx file in the 'square lattice' folder for more details.
This project is based on Comsol and Matlab. Note that the .mlx files can be opened through Matlab.
Finally, I recommend paper arXiv:2001.08913, where a Matlab code to compute Chern number for photonic crystals is publicly accessible (see its reference list).
